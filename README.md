# p5-neighborhood-map

This project is using the MVVM design pattern to avoid spaghetti *(yum yum)* code. Specifically cares about classifying different frontend components because the standard Model, View, Whatever classification is enough to handle all components of backend apps but on frontend applications even after throwing some standard components on each of this bucket you have some of them in your hands. Anyway this project is using the knockoutJS library and google maps APIs to create a neighborhood map I would like to visit!

The live demo of this project is available [here](https://rehanumar.github.io/p5-neighborhood-map/index.html)
